# Algorithm_3Sem
Implemented the Aho-Corasick algorithm which constructs finite-state machine on a given text and then uses it for locating elements of a finite set of strings. Adjusted this algorithm to find the given pattern in a text containing multiple '?' symbols meaning that any character of an alphabet may be on a such place. (Followed the google code style.)
